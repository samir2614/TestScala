quick summary of the yield keyword:

   --  For each iteration of your for loop, yield generates a value which is remembered by the for loop (behind the scenes, like a buffer).
   --  When your for loop finishes running, it returns a collection of all these yielded values.
   --  The type of the collection that is returned is the same type that you were iterating over.
